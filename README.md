```
scc -f json scc.output.json
```

# Providers

## Console

Simply outputs all metrics to the console.

**Usage**:

The console provider prints metrics in the format `metric_name: value`. If metrics include tags (using the `#` delimiter format), they are printed as is:

```
requests: 100
errors: 5  
requests#production: 200
latency#backend,region:us-east-1,env:prod: 150
```

## Datadog

Sends metrics to Datadog using the Datadog API. Supports metric tagging for better organization and filtering.

**Environment Variables**:

- `DATADOG_API_KEY` (required): your Datadog API key
- `DATADOG_PREFIX` (optional): prefix to add to all metric names (default: `'codemonitor.'`)

**Metric Tagging**:

The Datadog provider supports adding tags to metrics by including them in the metric name using the `#` delimiter:

- Format: `metric_name#tag1,tag2:value,tag3`
- Example: `requests#frontend,app:webserver` → sends metric `requests` with tags `['frontend', 'app:webserver']`
- Tags follow Datadog's standard format where tags can be simple (`tag`) or key-value pairs (`key:value`)

# Contribute

This project started as a side project, so I'm sure that is full
of mistakes and areas to be improve. If you think you can tweak the code to
make it better, I'll really appreciate a pull request. ;)
